      <div class="accordion-body">Preconception counseling refers to an exam to determine whether you have any health issues that could affect your ability to carry a full-term pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby. By identifying any problems, the doctors at The Ob-Gyn Center can recommend lifestyle changes and treatments that optimize your health before you become pregnant.

      <div class="accordion-body">You’ll receive an ultrasound at your first visit to confirm your pregnancy, precisely determine your baby’s gestational age, and find out whether you’re carrying more than one baby.
For most women, the next ultrasound is during the second trimester to evaluate the baby’s growth and anatomy, verify placenta location, and possibly learn the baby’s gender. However, the certified technicians may perform a 2D, 3D, or 4D ultrasound at any time during your pregnancy if your doctor needs to evaluate your baby’s development.</div>
